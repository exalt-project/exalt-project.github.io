[**Anna Kiriliouk**](https://akiriliouk.github.io/) (coordinator) ​is an assistant professor in Statistics at the *Department of Mathematics* and the *Economics, Management, Communication and Politics faculty* of the University
of Namur (UNamur). Her main research field is extreme value theory, with a focus on environmental applications, the development of statistical methodology for multivariate extremes, high-dimensional modelling, and spatial extremes. Recently, she has been particularly interested in topics related to the climate sciences, such as climate extreme event attribution and compound extremes.

[**Francesco Ragone**](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/francesco.ragone) (coordinator UCLouvain) is assistant professor at the *Earth and Climate Centre* of the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) and  senior researcher at the Royal Meteorological Institute (RMI) of Belgium. My research interests focus on
the application of techniques from statistical physics and dynamical systems theory to the study of
climate problems.
