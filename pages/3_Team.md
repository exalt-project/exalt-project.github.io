# Researchers

<div style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <img src="/assets/img/pics/Robert_Paulus.jpg" alt="Robert Paulus" class="team-photo">
    <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0;">
        <a href="https://github.com/RPGSynth" target="_blank"><strong>Robert Paulus</strong></a> is a PhD student at Université de Namur under the supervision of Anna Kiriliouk and Francesco Ragone. His research aims to enhance our understanding of extreme flooding events across Europe by developing innovative and flexible univariate visualization tools to provide robust, location-specific estimates of intense flooding occurrences. He is particularly focused on studying recent catastrophic flood events, such as those in Belgium, Germany, and Spain, and exploring the influence of global warming on these extraordinary precipitation events. Robert's work also extends to examining social indicators and the societal impacts of extreme climate events, in collaboration with Sébastien Dujardin at Unamur. Ultimately, his research aims to link climate data attribution techniques with social insights to better address the impacts of extreme flooding events.

    <img src="/assets/img/pics/Alexandre.jpeg" alt="Alexandre Tytgat" class="team-photo">
    <p align="justify" style="margin-top: 0;">
        <a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>Alexandre Tytgat</strong></a> is a PhD student at Université Catholique de Louvain under the supervision of François Massonnet and Anna Kiriliouk. His research focuses on improving our understanding of unprecedented sea ice extent lows in the Antarctic region by providing robust estimates of their probabilities and quantifying the contributions of key drivers. He is particularly interested in the regional dynamics of sea ice within the various Antarctic basins and the role of specific drivers in these extremes, as well as the implications for current and future climate conditions. To this end, he aims to develop novel non-stationary multivariate models and attribution techniques tailored to Antarctic sea ice extent extremes.
